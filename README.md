# FSUList

The development of this project tested my knowledge of Lists and Deques and 
techniques required to creating linked structures dynamically. I had to implement
various portions of the template classes List<T> & ListIterator<T>. These mods are
found in list.cpp.

name.com is a command file for flist.cpp such that:
1. The characters of my first name are inserted into x1 in alphabetical order, with
    the first letter capitalized
2. The characters of my last name are inserted into x2 just as above^
3. Finishing with the commands to accomplish x3=x1; x3+=x2; x3.Display(std::cout)
    printing the name to the screen with first & last name separated by _.
4. Note character insert order is alphabetical, and traversal order spell name.
